Sweep (`swp`) finds old projects that haven't been changed in more than a month. It will clean up and remove unnecessary directories containing libraries, dependencies, builds, etc. These files can easily be re-generated at any time by running install or build commands, and if you haven't worked on the project in a while you probably don't need them taking up space right now.
